+
+
+OVERVIEW
+========
+
+This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
+decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
+method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
+"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
+are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
+exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you
+have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,
+very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and
+remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
+low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment
+with various compression settings.
+
+This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
+compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
+processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
+For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding
+variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting
+the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.
+
+We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
+plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
+perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
+The library is intended to be reused in other applications.
+
+In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
+considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
+for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
+decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
+colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
+library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included
+"jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
+processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for
+inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
+
+The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
+flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
+the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
+REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
+be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
+achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.
+
+We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
+No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
+documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.
+
+
+LEGAL ISSUES
+============
+
+In plain English:
+
+1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
+   please let us know!)
+2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
+3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
+   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
+   you've used the IJG code.
+
+In legalese:
+
+The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
+with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
+fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
+its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
+
+This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
+All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
+
+Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
+software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
+conditions:
+(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
+README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
+unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
+must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
+(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
+documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
+the Independent JPEG Group".
+(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
+full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
+NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
+
+These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
+not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
+acknowledge us.
+
+Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
+in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
+it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
+software".
+
+We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
+commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
+assumed by the product vendor.
+
+
+ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
+sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
+ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
+by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
+that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
+ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
+of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
+the foregoing paragraphs do.
+
+The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
+It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
+The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
+ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
+by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
+
+It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
+patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
+legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
+support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
+(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
+Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
+So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
+code.
+
+The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
+To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
+been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
+"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
+resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
+GIF decoders.
+
+We are required to state that
+    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated."
+
+
+REFERENCES
+==========
+
+We highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
+understand the innards of the JPEG software.
+
+The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
+	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
+	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
+(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
+applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
+handy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
+available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually
+a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
+omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
+and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
+and it may not be used for commercial purposes.
+
+A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
+"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
+M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
+good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
+including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
+code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
+sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
+at a full implementation, you've got one here...
+
+The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data
+Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published
+by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.
+The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1
+and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG
+in existence, and we highly recommend it.
+
+The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a
+paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified
+official copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;
+it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)
+In the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)
+642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI
+doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of
+1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%
+shipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the
+actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1
+is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
+Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
+10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
+Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
+numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
+
+Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,
+a newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG
+currently does not support any Part 3 extensions.
+
+The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
+format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
+1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:
+	Literature Department
+	C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
+	1778 McCarthy Blvd.
+	Milpitas, CA 95035
+	phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314
+A PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at
+ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text
+version at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing
+the figures.
+
+The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
+ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
+found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
+IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
+Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
+(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or
+from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision
+of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
+Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
+uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available
+from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.
+
+
+ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
+=================
+
+The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet
+address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found
+there in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived
+as ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have
+direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact
+help@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.
+
+Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only
+ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.
+
+You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" archive format from
+the SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or
+on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12
+"JPEG Tools".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net
+release.
+
+The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of
+general information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is
+not included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to
+Usenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.
+It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/
+and other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers
+archive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.
+If you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

+
+RELATED SOFTWARE
+================
+
+Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a
+few of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists
+some of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to
+obtain them on Internet.
+
+If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free
+PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image
+files.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of
+other formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest
+version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous
+sites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.
+Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;
+you are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.
+
+A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,
+is available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program
+is designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;
+it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it
+is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,
+which we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)
+
+
+FILE FORMAT WARS
+================
+
+Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.
+The root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a
+concrete file format.  Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own,
+creating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none
+of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to
+exchange compressed files.)
+
+The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format
+has been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has
+become the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.
+We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF
+Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications that need to record a lot of
+additional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely
+supported, unfortunately.
+
+The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.
+SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should
+be able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical
+advantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an
+official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear
+whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto
+standard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we
+have not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.
+(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)
+
+Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.
+We have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,
+one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help
+force convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't
+use a proprietary file format!
+
+
+TO DO
+=====
+
+The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.
+The current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be
+very good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary
+smoothing, "poor man's variable quantization", and other means of improving
+quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.
+
+In future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG
+Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file
+format.
+
+As always, speeding things up is of great interest.
+
+Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

+		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2.1, February 1999
+
+ Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
+ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
+ the version number 2.1.]
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+
+  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
+specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
+Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
+these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+
+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
+introduced by others.
+
+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
+
+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
+libraries into non-free programs.
+
+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
+the library.
+
+  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
+special circumstances.
+
+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
+
+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
+system.
+
+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
+that program using a modified version of the Library.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
+be combined with the library in order to run.
+
+		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
+this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
+Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+
+  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
+which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
+Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+included without limitation in the term "modification".)
+
+  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
+and installation of the library.
+
+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+and what the program that uses the Library does.
+  
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+Library.
+
+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
+
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
+
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
+
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
+
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
+
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
+
+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
+
+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
+
+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
+
+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
+
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
+
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
+
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
+
+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
+ordinary General Public License).
+
+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
+"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
+    Lesser General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
+  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

+
+2. Source Code License.
+
+     2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
+     The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
+     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
+     claims:
+          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
+          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
+          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
+          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
+          as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
+          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
+          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
+          Original Code (or portions thereof).
+
+          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
+          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
+          Original Code under the terms of this License.
+
+          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
+          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
+          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
+          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
+          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
+
+     2.2. Contributor Grant.
+     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
+     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
+
+          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
+          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
+          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
+          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
+          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
+          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
+          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
+          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
+          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
+          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
+          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
+          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
+          Version (or portions of such combination).
+
+          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
+          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
+          the Covered Code.
+
+          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
+          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
+          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
+          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
+          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
+          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
+          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
+          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
+          that Contributor.
+
+3. Distribution Obligations.
+
+     3.1. Application of License.
+     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
+     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
+     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
+     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
+     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
+     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
+     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
+     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
+     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
+     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
+     Section 3.5.
+
+     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
+     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
+     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
+     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
+     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
+     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
+     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
+     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
+     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
+     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
+     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
+     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
+
+     3.3. Description of Modifications.
+     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
+     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
+     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
+     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
+     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
+     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
+     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
+     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
+
+     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
+          (a) Third Party Claims.
+          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
+          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
+          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
+          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
+          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
+          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
+          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
+          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
+          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
+          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
+          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
+          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
+          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
+
+          (b) Contributor APIs.
+          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
+          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
+          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
+          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
+
+               (c)    Representations.
+          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
+          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
+          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
+          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
+          this License.
+
+     3.5. Required Notices.
+     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
+     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
+     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
+     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
+     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
+     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
+     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
+     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
+     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
+     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
+     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
+     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
+     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
+     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
+     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
+     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
+     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
+     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
+
+     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
+     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
+     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
+     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
+     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
+     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
+     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
+     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
+     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
+     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
+     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
+     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
+     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
+     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
+     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
+     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
+     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
+     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
+     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
+     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
+     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
+     terms You offer.
+
+     3.7. Larger Works.
+     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
+     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
+     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
+     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
+
+     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
+     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
+     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
+     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
+     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
+     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
+     understand it.
+
+5. Application of this License.
+
+     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
+     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
+
+6. Versions of the License.
+
+     6.1. New Versions.
+     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
+     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
+     will be given a distinguishing version number.
+
+     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
+     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
+     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
+     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
+     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
+     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
+     Covered Code created under this License.
+
+     6.3. Derivative Works.
+     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
+     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
+     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
+     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
+     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
+     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
+     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
+     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
+     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
+     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
+     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
+     this License.)
+
+7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
+
+     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
+     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
+     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
+     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
+     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
+     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
+     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
+     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
+     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
+     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
+
+8. TERMINATION.
+
+     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
+     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
+     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
+     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
+     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
+     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
+     shall survive.
+
+     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
+     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
+     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
+     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
+
+     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
+     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
+     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
+     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
+     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
+     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
+     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
+     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
+     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
+     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
+     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
+     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
+     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
+     the 60 day notice period specified above.
+
+     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
+     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
+     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
+     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
+     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
+     Participant.
+
+     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
+     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
+     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
+     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
+     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
+     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
+     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
+     license.
+
+     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
+     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
+     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
+     prior to termination shall survive termination.
+
+9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
+
+     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
+     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
+     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
+     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
+     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
+     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
+     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
+     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
+     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
+     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
+     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
+     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
+     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
+     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
+
+     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
+     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
+     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
+     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
+     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
+     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
+     rights set forth herein.
+
+11. MISCELLANEOUS.
+
+     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
+     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
+     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
+     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
+     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
+     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
+     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
+     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
+     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
+     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
+     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
+     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
+     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
+     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
+     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
+     License.
+
+12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
+
+     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
+     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
+     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
+     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
+     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
+     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
+
+13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
+
+     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
+     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
+     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
+     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
+     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

+
+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
+non-exclusive license:
+
+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
+    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
+    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
+    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

+    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
+become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
+distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
+this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
+distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
+Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
+Contributor:
+
+(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
+    or
+
+(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
+    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
+    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
+    Version); or
+
+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
+    its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
+equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
+in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+-------------------
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+--------------
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular

+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.

+8. Litigation
+-------------
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
+courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
+place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
+jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
+Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
+cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+----------------
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
+that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
+shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License

+10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
+publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
+distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
+of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
+or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
+steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
+create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
+modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
+any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
+such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
+Licenses

+Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
